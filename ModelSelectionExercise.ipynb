    "You are to explore the data set on speed dating and justify at least 3 models to enable predictions within the dataset.  The models must come from different model areas such as listed as categories in the [ModelTypes](./ModelTypes.pdf) document.  You must justify your answer considering the data and the prediction value.\n",

    "The data is contained in [SpeedDatingData.csv](SpeedDatingData.csv).  The values are detailed in [SpeedDatingKey.md](./SpeedDatingKey.md).  The directory also contains the original key document - SpeedDatingDataKey.docx but jupyter lab is unable to render it.  You are free to render it outside of jupyter lab if something didn't translater clearly.  The open source tool [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) was used to perform the translation.  It is useful for almost any translation and works in all major operating systems."
